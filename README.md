Similar to a Furnace the **Igneous Crafter** allows you to insert/extract items via hoppers from different sides of the block. Fuel can be inserted from the side, the crafting inventory can be inserted to from the top and the results can be extracted from the bottom.

### Igneous Miner
The **Igneous Miner** is able to use tools and fuel to mine the block in front of it. If it is given an axe for example it will be able to chop wood, with a pickaxe stone, etc.
