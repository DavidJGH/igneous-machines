Igneous Machines adds a few simple vanilla-like machines that enable automating your world.

## Machines Added

### Igneous Crafter
With the **Igneous Crafter** you can automate crafting. Lay out the recipe you want to automate, supply fuel and the required resources for your selected recipe and you're good to go.

Similar to a Furnace the **Igneous Crafter** allows you to insert/extract items via hoppers from different sides of the block. Fuel can be inserted from the side, the crafting inventory can be inserted to from the top and the results can be extracted from the bottom.

### Igneous Miner
The **Igneous Miner** is able to use tools and fuel to mine the block in front of it. If it is given an axe for example it will be able to chop wood, with a pickaxe stone, etc.

It also allows for inserting/extracting items via hoppers from different sides. Fuel from the side, tools from the top and mined blocks can be extracted from the bottom.

### Depositer
The **Depositer** works like a Dropper/Dispenser, but it is instead able to place blocks in front of it.
